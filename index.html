	<h1>hi</h1>
	<p>this is a work in progress (in case you couldn't tell)</p>
	<p>I'm an 18 year old student from Germany, aspiring to become a system administrator. I like tinkering around
		with my linux and write a little program here and there.</p>
	<p>Currently I'm learning a bunch about server monitoring, as part of a school project</p>
